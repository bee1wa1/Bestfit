This Streamlit application is designed to identify and visualize the best-fitting probability distributions for both raw datasets and histograms. It serves as a versatile statistical tool for engineers, analysts, and researchers who need to model data behavior, perform reliability analysis, or compare distributional assumptions across datasets.
The app offers two main modes, accessible via separate tabs:Best Fit – Dataset: Upload or paste a list of numeric values to analyze directly. Best Fit – Histogram: Upload or input binned data in (value,count) or (left,right,count) format to estimate the underlying distribution.
It supports several commonly used statistical distributions, including Normal, Lognormal (2P and 3P), Weibull (2P and 3P), Gamma (2P and 3P), and Exponential (1P). For each selected distribution, the app estimates parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and computes key statistical metrics such as log-likelihood, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test statistics with p-values.
Results are presented in a ranked summary table that highlights the best-fitting model according to AIC. The app also includes interactive Plotly charts that overlay fitted Probability Density Functions (PDFs) on histograms or binned data, making it easy to visually assess how well each model describes the data.
An additional feature is the percentile table, which compares empirical percentiles (from the dataset or histogram) with theoretical percentiles derived from each fitted distribution, helping users interpret the model’s accuracy at specific quantiles.
For histogram input, users can optionally generate synthetic datasets by expanding or proportionally sampling bin midpoints according to their counts. These datasets can then be exported as CSV, TXT, or Excel files for further use in other tools or simulations.
With its clear visualizations, flexibility in input formats, and export capabilities, this app provides a powerful, user-friendly platform for exploring and validating statistical distributions in reliability, quality, and data analysis applications.
